### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a Belgian computer science student @KULeuven.
- I use Rust and C++
- I work on projects related to computer graphics, typically using Vulkan.
- Sometimes I write about my projects at <https://www.notapenguin.blog/>

### Current projects:

#### [Phobos](https://github.com/NotAPenguin0/phobos-rs)

A Rust library for Vulkan on desktop. Phobos provides abstractions to remove Vulkan boilerplate, manage resources and automate
synchronization.

#### [Andromeda](https://github.com/NotAPenguin0/andromeda-rs)

A 3D terrain engine and landscape editor in Rust.
